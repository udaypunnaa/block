# Website Blocker - Security Features Update

## Overview
This document outlines the enhanced security features implemented in the Website Blocker application as requested. All security features are now active and functional.

## New Security Features

### 1. Admin Password Protection for "Check Malicious Status"
- **Feature**: The "Check Malicious Status" button now requires admin password authentication
- **Default Password**: `admin123`
- **Implementation**: 
  - When clicking "Check Malicious Status", users must enter the admin password
  - Password input is masked with asterisks for security
  - Incorrect passwords display "Access Denied" error
  - Users can cancel the operation if needed

### 2. Email Verification for File Upload Operations
- **Feature**: Both bulk block and unblock file operations now require email verification
- **Process**:
  1. User selects a file to upload (block or unblock)
  2. System generates a secure 8-character verification code
  3. Verification code is sent to the configured admin email
  4. User must enter the received code to proceed
  5. Operation executes only upon correct code entry

- **Email Configuration**:
  - Sender Email: `udaypunna1807@gmail.com`
  - Admin Email: `udaypunna1807@gmail.com`
  - SMTP Server: Gmail (smtp.gmail.com:587)
  - Uses app-specific password for authentication

### 3. Bulk Website Safety Check Feature
- **Feature**: New "Upload file to check" button in the malicious status section
- **Functionality**: 
  - Bulk check multiple URLs from a file for malicious content
  - Requires admin password authentication
  - Uses Google Safe Browsing API for each URL
  - Categorizes results into Safe, Malicious, and Error tabs
  - Option to block all detected malicious URLs directly
  - Progress tracking during bulk operations
  - Detailed results window with tabbed interface

### 4. Enhanced Security Flow
- **Single URL Operations**: Also require email verification before execution
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed email delivery or incorrect codes
- **User Cancellation**: Users can cancel verification at any point
- **Threading**: All verification processes run in background threads to prevent UI freezing

## Security Implementation Details

### Code Structure
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` constant set to "admin123"
- `verify_and_execute()` method handles email verification flow
- `generate_verification_code()` creates cryptographically secure codes
- `send_verification_email()` handles SMTP email delivery
- `request_verification_code()` provides user input dialog
- `request_admin_password()` handles admin authentication

### Email Security
- Uses TLS encryption (STARTTLS)
- App-specific password instead of account password
- Secure random code generation using `secrets` module
- Email verification codes expire after single use

### User Experience
- Clear dialog boxes for password and code entry
- Informative success/error messages
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Graceful handling of user cancellations

## Updated Executable
- **File**: `WebsiteBlocker.exe` (located in `dist/` folder)
- **Size**: Approximately 17MB
- **Features**: All security features are fully functional
- **Requirements**: Must be run as Administrator for hosts file modifications

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Password (Check Status):
1. **Single URL Check**: Click "Check Status" button
2. Enter URL in the input field
3. Enter admin password: `admin123`
4. Proceed with malicious status check

### For Bulk URL Check (Upload File):
1. Click "Upload file to check" button
2. Enter admin password: `admin123`
3. Select file containing URLs to check
4. View detailed results with safe/malicious/error categories
5. Option to block all detected malicious URLs directly

### For Email Verification (File Uploads):
1. Click "Upload file to block" or "Upload file to unblock"
2. Select the file containing URLs
3. Check your email for verification code
4. Enter the received code when prompted
5. Operation executes upon successful verification

### For Single URL Operations:
1. Enter URL in block/unblock field
2. Click Block/Unblock button
3. Check email for verification code
4. Enter code to complete operation

## Security Considerations
- Admin password should be changed in production environments
- Email credentials should be stored securely
- Verification codes are single-use and secure
- All sensitive operations require authentication
- User inputs are properly validated and sanitized

## Testing
- All features have been tested and are working correctly
- Error scenarios are handled appropriately
- UI remains responsive during verification processes
- Email delivery is confirmed functional

## Files Modified
- `malicious_website_blocker.py` - Main application with security features
- `WebsiteBlocker.exe` - Updated executable with new features
- `config.py` - Contains API configuration (unchanged)

## Next Steps
- Deploy the updated executable to target systems
- Ensure email configuration is properly set up
- Test in production environment
- Consider implementing password change functionality for enhanced security
